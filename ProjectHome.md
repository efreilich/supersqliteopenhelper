SuperSQLiteOpenHelper is a Android library that extends the basic SQLiteOpenHelper for ease of use and automatic management.

Automatic database version management is handled from a simple to read, standard format.  It also includes build in functions to import and export the database to and from a DOM Element (or directly to/from a file).  It also includes several database helpers for general use.  This library was written for Android 2.1 (API 7).

To use, a developer can extend the class (as with the normal SQLiteOpenHelper) and add custom interface methods specific to their database.
